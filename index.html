        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Self-Driving RC Car</h3>
            <p>Designed a self-driving RC car utilizing CAN Bus, GPS, Compass, and an Android application to navigate from source to destination. 
                The car successfully implements the obstacle avoidance algorithm in addition to self-navigation. 
                All the nodes (sensor, motor, bridge controller, GPS, compass, driver) communicated on CAN Bus. 
                Worked on Motor and Sensor nodes for effective navigation on up and down-hill terrain. Simulated and 
                analyzed CAN data over CAN bus using BUS MASTER tool. This project incorporated SJTwo LPC4078(NXP) board, HRLV-MaxSonar-EZ1 sensor, Servo, and DC motor. 
                Implemented FreeRTOS-based periodic callbacks to efficiently handle tasks in real-time.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Two-Channel Oscilloscope</h3>
            <p>Designed and Implemented a Two-channel Oscilloscope supporting frequencies ranging from 20mHz to 10KHz on the PSoC6 Evaluation Board. 
                Enabled ADC on GPIO pins for continuous digital conversion of two external analog input signals with reference to Vref signal.
                 Achieved Real-Time data plotting on Serial Plotter and Multitasking using DMA and Interrupt. 
                 Used Modus Tool Box (Eclipse IDE) and coded in C, HAL(Hardware Abstraction Layer) APIs, 
                 and platform-specific PSoC6 PDL(Peripheral Driver Library) libraries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Home Applications Control using Gesture Recognition</h3>
            <p>Designed and Implemented a home automation system to control external household lights using various hand gestures. 
                Hardware design included light interfacing with Arduino UNO R3 and relay circuitry. 
                Software design included implementation using OpenCV, Google's MediaPipe library,
                 and Arduino Pyfirmata library to use Python for the Arduino board. 
                 A webcam is used as an input device for the detection and recognition of hand gestures using MediaPipe ML Model framework and OpenCV.</p>
                 </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Voice-Activated Smart Home System</h3>
            <p>Created a voice-activated smart home system with PSoC 62S2 Kit, 
                featuring motion detection and light control using Embedded C and MQTT protocol.</p>
